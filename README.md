# Amazon Clone

This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon e-commerce website, built primarily using HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and features of the Amazon shopping experience, including a homepage, product pages, cart functionality, and sign-in/sign-up flows.

## Features

- **Homepage (`index.html`)**:  
  - Navigation bar with country, language, and search options
  - Product slider showcasing best sellers and deals
  - Multiple product category sections (Fashion Mart, Toys, Devices, etc.)
  - Footer with Amazon branding

- **Product Page (`product.html`)**:  
  - Detailed product display with images, price, offers, and purchase options
  - Additional recommended product sections
  - Footer with copyright

- **Cart Page (`cart.html`)**:
  - Shows items added to the cart
  - Retains navigation and search functionalities

- **Sign-in/Sign-up (`signin.html`, `signup.html`)**:
  - User authentication interface (UI only, no backend)
  - Links to create a new account

- **Reusable Components**:
  - Navigation bar and footer are consistent across pages
  - Product cards and sliders for showcasing items

## File Structure

- `index.html` — Main homepage of the Amazon clone
- `product.html` — Product details page
- `cart.html` — Shopping cart page
- `signin.html` — Sign-in form
- `signup.html` — Sign-up form (linked from sign-in)
- `style.css` — Primary styling for layout, navigation, product cards, etc.
- `cart.css`, `product.css` — Additional CSS for cart and product pages
- `script.js` — (Referenced, likely used for interactivity)
- Various image assets:  
  - Logos (`amazon_logo.png`), icons (search, cart, location), product images (`product_img.jpg`, etc.), and banners

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repository**
2. Open `index.html` in your browser — no build step required
3. Navigate between pages using links in the navigation bar

## Notes

- This is a **static front-end project**; there is no backend or database.
- All data (products, users, cart) is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.
- For a full e-commerce experience, backend logic and user authentication would need to be implemented.
